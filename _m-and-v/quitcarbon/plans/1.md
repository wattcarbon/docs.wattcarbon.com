## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the electrification projects managed by QuitCarbon. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies. 

## Evidence of Asset

QuitCarbon will provide evidence that will demonstrate the installation of the measure. They will also need to include the heat pump serial number on Asset upload.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.url }}) methodology.

We expect to receive 12 pre-intervention bills representing approximately 12 months of data that will be provided upon Asset upload. For the first 12 months of post-intervention, WattCarbon will receive bills. and use the "From EEMeter Model, if reporting data is available (Baseline: 1.1.2.1 and Reporting: 1.2.2.1). After 12 months, the Asset will switch to "From 1-year of reporting data, for post-1-year impacts (Baseline: 1.1.2.1 and Reporting 1.2.3.1).

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

### User-Provided Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset.
An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/assets/csv/template/electrification_billing_metered) and timeseries description [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/#tag/Meters/operation/Meters-upload_meter_intervals).

### Attributional Data

The following data is required in addition to what is listed in [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology.

### Timeseries Data

The timeseries data should be provided with the following columns:

| Field | Description | Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| start\_date | The date representing the start of the bill cycle | Y |
| end\_date | The date representing the end of the bill cycle | Y |

## Data Management/Auditing Agreements

### Timeseries Data

QuitCarbon is partnering with UtilityAPI, which will supply the electricity and gas bills used in this analysis. At around the time of the intervention, UtilityAPI will provide the most recent 12 months of electricity and gas bills leading up to the intervention. These readings will be used to establish the baseline consumption of the building.

For example, if an intervention took place on **June 5, 2022**, and the following bills existed for that home, we would take the bills 2021-06-18 through 2022-05-18 to represent the baseline consumption, but we would *exclude* the bill 2022-06-10 as it is partially in both the pre \-and post-intervention periods.
