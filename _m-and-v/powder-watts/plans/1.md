## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology implemented to quantify energy savings resulting from heat cable monitoring systems installed by PowderWatts. The plan encompasses metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies. 

## Evidence of Asset

The following documentation is maintained to support verification:

1. Hourly consumption data records

## Methodology Selection

We will be using the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.heat_cables.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.heat_cables.url }}) which uses measured electricity consumption and computes a counterfactual based on maximum daily power consumption. This M&V plan calculates the savings for each device and aggregates them at the site level.

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset. An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/devices/csv/template/estimated_sampled_measured_reporting_lighting) and a time series description [is available here](https://docs.wattcarbon.com/docs/wattcarbon/qgeogozj1wujc-upload-device-timeseries). The daily aggregation data must be uploaded as a document with the columns aligning with the **Daily Aggregated Data** description below.

## Verification Protocols

### Data Validation

Ongoing verification procedures include:

- Confirmation of data completeness
- Congruency between methodology aggregation and provided aggregation
- Review of savings calculations

This M\&V plan provides a robust framework for quantifying and verifying energy savings while maintaining conservative calculation approaches and comprehensive documentation standards.
