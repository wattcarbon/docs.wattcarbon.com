## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the electrification projects managed by BlocPower. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies. 

## Evidence of Asset

BlocPower will provide evidence that will demonstrate the installation of the measure. They will also need to include the heat pump serial number on Asset upload.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.url }}) methodology.

We expect to use "From NREL ResStock SqFt-Based Load Selection (Baseline: 1.1.3.2 and Reporting: 1.2.5.2).

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

### User-Provided Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset.
An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/assets/csv/template/electrification_nrel_resstock_deemed) and timeseries description [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/#tag/Meters/operation/Meters-upload_meter_intervals).

### Attributional Data

The following data is required in addition to what is listed in [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology.
