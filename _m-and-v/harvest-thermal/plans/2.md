## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the electrification projects managed by Harvest Thermal. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification_device_sensors.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification_device_sensors.url }}) methodology.

We expect to receive device-level reporting data and information about the legacy system.

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

### User-Provided Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset.
See the [updated CSV template with the correct column names](https://api.wattcarbon.com/assets/csv/template/electrification_nrel_resstock_deemed) and [timeseries description](https://api.wattcarbon.com/#tag/Meters/operation/Meters-upload_meter_intervals).

### Attributional Data

The following data is required in addition to what is listed in [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology.

## Data Management/Auditing Agreements

Harvest Thermal will aggregate the minute-level data electricity into hourly, as well as calculate the heating and cooling outputs based on the minute-level temperature differentials (qDHW, qHeat, qHpacHeat, qHpacCool). All values will be in units of BTUs.

Harvest Thermal will supply the device telemetry data used in this analysis. The data will be made available through periodic CSV dumps into a private Google Drive folder.
