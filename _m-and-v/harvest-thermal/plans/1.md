## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the electrification projects managed by Harvest Thermal. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies.

## Evidence of Asset

Harvest Thermal will upload a photo of a receipt of each Asset that will include the line-item of the subsidy provided by this program. They will also need to include the heat pump serial number on Asset upload.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification_device_sensors.url }}) methodology.

We expect to receive device-level reporting data (Baseline: 1.1.1, Reporting: 1.2.1), and a fixed prior-fuel efficiency factor to estimate the counterfactual data. We will assume that the UEF of the pre-intervention appliance(s) is 0.63, based on the [DOE standard](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=80dfa785ea350ebeee184bb0ae03e7f0&mc=true&node=se10.3.430_132&rgn=div8) for high-flow water heaters. The space heating uses the same heating source as the water, so the same UEF is applied to both space and water heating. Fan use will be assumed to be the same in both the baseline and reporting periods.

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:
