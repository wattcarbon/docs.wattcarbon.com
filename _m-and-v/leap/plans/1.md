## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the Demand Reponse events managed by LEAP. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies.

## Evidence of Asset

LEAP provides direct access to the same data that is reported to CISO.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.demand_response_ciso.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.demand_response_ciso.url }}) methodology.

We expect to use Section 5.4.

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules 
- EAC Definition and Rules
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

### User-Provided Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset.
An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/assets/csv/template/solar) and timeseries description [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/#tag/Meters/operation/Meters-upload_meter_intervals).

### Attributional Data

The following data is required in addition to what is listed in [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology.
