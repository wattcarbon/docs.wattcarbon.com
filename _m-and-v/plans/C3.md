# C3 Measurement and Verification Plan

# Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology implemented to quantify energy savings resulting from lighting system upgrades at Berry Global's facility. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies.

# Evidence of Asset

The following documentation is maintained to support verification:

1. Utility bills to corroborate baseline consumption  
2. Post-implementation photographic documentation  
3. Metering system installation documentation  
4. Executed Site Service Agreement  
5. Circuit inventory and mapping documentation  
6. Hourly consumption data records

# Definitions

- **EFLH**: effective full load-hours are a sort of compound unit like watt-hours, they are a proxy for energy consumed by a lighting fixture, in that  they are the \# of hours over a period of time assuming the lighting load is at full capacity. EFLH/hour is similar to Wh/h, where it can be seen either as a percent of the time the lights are at full load or a percent of the load that was on for that hour (similar to thinking of Wh/h as energy consumed within the hour or average wattage over the course of the hour). Since we will be using this term exclusively hourly, we can colloquially think of it as "% of lights turned on".

# Methodology Selection

We will be using the **Sample-Measured Reporting (Modeled Baseline, Estimated Measured Wattage) Lighting Methodology** which uses measured lighting consumption from a large sample of the installed fixtures, as well as a model of the pre-intervention wattage and EFLH to calculate the hourly carbon impact of the intervention.

# Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset. An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/devices/csv/template/electrification_nrel_resstock_deemed) and a time series description [is available here](https://docs.wattcarbon.com/docs/wattcarbon/qgeogozj1wujc-upload-device-timeseries).

# Savings Calculation Methodology

## Methodology (Deemed or Measured Baseline, Measured Reporting)

This methodology can be used for an individual light fixture or set of light fixtures depending on lighting consumption measurement constraints.

Data Requirements:

* Wpre\[i\]: pre-retrofit wattage for each lighting fixture *i*  
* Wpost\[i\]: post-retrofit wattage for each lighting fixture *i*  
* For estimating the pre-retrofit EFLH, one of:  
  * \>1 day of Pre-Retrofit Measured Consumption Data  
  * Citable simulated results of pre-retrofit annual EFLH for each lighting fixture i  
* For the post-retrofit measurement data, one of:  
  * Hourly measured reporting data that covers 100% of lighting fixtures  
  * Hourly measured reporting data that covers at least X% of lighting fixtures and one of:  
    * A list of all lighting fixtures that are being measured so the total measured wattage is known  
    * \> 1 month of minute-level measured reporting data for the X% of lighting fixtures that are measured, so that a static peak wattage analysis can be conducted.

## Measurement

## 1\. Sum the Total Power of the Lighting Fixtures

Wpre\=iWpre\[i\]: Based on the Pre/Post Inventory document, sum up the total wattage of the pre-retrofit fixtures.  
Wpost\=iWpost\[i\]: Based on the Pre/Post Inventory document, sum up the total wattage of the post-retrofit fixtures.

## 2\. Calculate the Post-Retrofit (Actual) Reporting Period EFLH and Consumption

### 100% of Post-Retrofit is Measured

If 100% of lighting fixtures are measured in the reporting period, then this value is simply the total measured energy consumption timeseries: kWhreporting(t)=kWhreporting,measured(t).

### \<100% of Post-Retrofit is Measured

*Assumption: The usage behavior of the measured fixtures is representative of that of all fixtures.*

First calculate the Wpost,measured based on adding up the wattages of the lighting fixtures that are measured. If the specific fixtures being measured are not labeled, then a “static peak wattage” analysis will need to be conducted.

#### Static Peak Wattage Analysis

Using the reporting period minute-level data, find the total maximum wattage consumed by the measured lighting fixtures. Use this as an estimate for Wpost,measured, 

The Static Peak Wattage analysis assumes that there is a minute within this subset of reporting period data where all of the lights are simultaneously on (and therefore the total wattage can be measured). This analysis is inherently conservative, as there may not be a minute where this takes place. This conservative approach means that the end savings may be lower than what they otherwise would be if the total measured Wattage was known.

Calculate the post-retrofit EFLH for each hour in the reporting period by dividing the energy consumed for that hour by the total wattage of the measured light fixtures: kWhreporting,measured(t)/ the Wpost,measured. 

Then multiply this EFLH by the total post-retrofit wattage Wpost to estimate the total energy   
consumption timeseries:

EFLHpost,measured(t)=Wpost,measuredkWhreporting,measured(t)  
kWhreporting(t)=EFLHpost,measured(t)\*Wpost

## 3\. Calculate Pre-Retrofit (Counterfactual) Reporting Period Consumption

To calculate the reporting period consumption, a model that can predict the EFLH for a given hour must be constructed.

#### Baseline Period data is available

- If \< 1 week is available: Calculate the average EFLH for each hour of the day (0-23). Then apply this EFLH to the reporting period, matching on hour of day  
- Else if \< 12 months of data available: Calculate the average EFLH for each hour of the week (0-167). Then apply this EFLH to the reporting period, matching on the hour of the week.  
- Else: Calculate the average EFLH or each hour of the year (0-8759/8783). Then apply this EFLH to the reporting period, matching on the hour of the week and week number of the year.

  #### Baseline Period data is not available

  There are 2 options for finding a deemed EFLH model when baseline data is not available.


  ##### Deemed Per Lighting Fixture Using Software Model

1. Based on the description for the pre-retrofit lighting fixtures, estimate the annual pre-retrofit EFLH.   
2. Based on the annual pre-retrofit EFLH divide this by 8760 to get the average EFLHpre/hour.   
3. Then, calculate the average EFLHpost/hour based on the EFLHpost,measured(t) timeseries.  
4. Calculate the adjustment from the difference between the post and pre average EFLH/hour: EFLH/hour= EFLHpost/hour \- EFLHpre/hour  
5. Add this value to each element of the EFLHpost,measure(t) timeseries to get the pre-retrofit EFLHpre,reporting(t) reporting period timeseries.

   ##### Deemed By Average EFLH of similar buildings in NREL Comstock

   Use the NREL ComStock database Warehouse building type and normalize the internal\_lighting load in the baseline so that it gives a % of max, which will represent an 8760 EFLH loadshape. This loadshape can be used to predict the EFLH when given an hour of week and week number. Apply the EFLH model to each hour of the reporting period to get the EFLHpre,reporting(t)

Multiply the EFLHpre,reporting(t) by Wpre to get the counterfactual consumption time series.

## 4\. Calculate the Reporting Period Savings

Subtract the counterfactual consumption time series by the measured energy consumption timeseries to calculate the energy savings timeseries.

# Verification Protocols

### Data Validation

Ongoing verification procedures include:

- Confirmation of data completeness  
- Assessment of burn hour calculations  
- Validation of circuit identification and mapping  
- Review of savings calculations

### Reasonableness Assessment

Multiple verification metrics ensure result validity:

1. Total savings represent 7% of facility consumption  
2. Post-implementation operating hours maintain logical relationship to baseline hours  
3. Connected load measurements align with documented system specifications

This M\&V plan provides a robust framework for quantifying and verifying energy savings while maintaining conservative calculation approaches and comprehensive documentation standards.
