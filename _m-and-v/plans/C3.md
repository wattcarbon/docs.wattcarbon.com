## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology implemented to quantify energy savings resulting from lighting system upgrades at Berry Global's facility. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies. 

## Evidence of Asset

The following documentation is maintained to support verification:

1. Utility bills to corroborate baseline consumption  
2. Post-implementation photographic documentation  
3. Metering system installation documentation  
4. Executed Site Service Agreement  
5. Circuit inventory and mapping documentation  
6. Hourly consumption data records

## Methodology Selection

We will be using the [Sample-Measured Reporting (Modeled Baseline, Estimated Measured Wattage) Lighting Methodology]({{ site.links.m_and_v.lighting }}) which uses measured lighting consumption from a large sample of the installed fixtures, as well as a model of the pre-intervention wattage and EFLH to calculate the hourly carbon impact of the intervention.

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [Basic Decarbonization Accounting Documentation]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared }}):

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset. An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/devices/csv/template/estimated_sampled_measured_reporting_lighting) and a time series description [is available here](https://docs.wattcarbon.com/docs/wattcarbon/qgeogozj1wujc-upload-device-timeseries). The lighting inventory must be uploaded as a document with the columns aligning with the **Intervention Inventory Data** description below. 

### Attributional Data

The following data is required in addition to what is listed in [The Shared Guidelines document.]({{ sites.m_and_v.shared }})

| Field | Description | Default if not provided | Required? | Use |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Commenced Operation Date | Date the intervention was completed | | Y |  |
| building\_type | Classification of building according to NREL ComStock categories |  |  |  |
| Source For Pre Eflh Estimation | Source of pre-wattage EFLH estimation |  | Y |  |
| Measurement Sampling Method | One of: \[	partial\_coverage\_unlabeled\_sampling, partial\_coverage\_labeled\_sampling, full\_coverage\_sampling\]  |  | Y |  |
| Static Wattage Analysis Summary First Dt | Datetime of start of static wattage analysis (if applicable) |  |  |  |
| Static Wattage Analysis Summary Last Dt  | Datetime of end of static wattage analysis (if applicable) |  |  |  |
| Static Wattage Analysis Summary Max Power (kW) | Maximum power measured during static wattage analysis |  |  |  |
| Static Wattage Analysis Summary Number of Panels Measured | Number of panels measured during static wattage analysis |  |  |  |
| Building Annual Consumption (kWh) | Total annual consumption of the building |  | Y |  |

### Intervention Inventory Data

The inventory of the full scope of the intervention should be provided as a CSV that has one row per fixture location installed with the following columns:

| Field | Description | Default if not provided | Required? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pre-Intervention Power Per Fixture (W) | Total wattage of each pre-retrofit fixture |  |  |
| Post-Intervention Power Per Fixture (W) | Total wattage of each post-retrofit fixture |  | Y |
| Pre-Intervention Fixture Description | A description of each pre-retrofit lighting fixture  |  | Y |
| Post-Intervention Fixture Description | A description of each post-retrofit lighting fixture  |  | Y |
| Pre-Intervention Fixture Quantity | Number of pre-retrofit light bulbs with the given wattage and description that were installed | 1 | Y |
| Post-Intervention Fixture Quantity | Number of post-retrofit light bulbs with the given wattage and description that were installed | 1 | Y |
| Pre-Intervention EFLH Estimate | An estimate of the Effective Full-Load Hours of the pre-intervention lighting fixtures. | Provided if pre-intervention occupancy schedules or measured data is not available. This is assumed to come from a modeling software. |  |
| is\_measured | Whether this fixture is part of the measurement ( for when only a sampling of the full intervention is being measured). | If 100% of fixtures are measured, defaults to Yes. Otherwise, defaults to Unknown (which requires an alternative means of estimating the measured wattage).  |  |
| pre\_intervention\_has\_controls | A boolean of whether the fixture had controls before it was replaced. Useful to better estimate the pre-intervention loadshape. |  |  |
| post\_intervention\_has\_controls | A boolean of whether the fixture had controls after it was replaced. Useful to better estimate the post-intervention loadshape. |  |  |

* Pre/Post Inventory: A line-item list of all installed lighting fixtures that includes:  
  * Total wattage of each pre-retrofit fixture  
  * Total wattage of each post-retrofit fixture  
  * A description of each pre-retrofit lighting fixture  
  * A description of each post-retrofit lighting fixture (perhaps even require model numbers?)  
  * Preferred:  
    *  If not all fixtures are being measured, a label of which fixtures are being measured.  
    * A boolean of if the pre-retrofit fixture has controls  
    * A boolean of if the post-retrofit fixture has controls  
* Pre-Retrofit Occupancy Schedules  
  * If available, measured hourly baseline period data (of at least 1 month)  
  * ***Otherwise, an estimated annual EFLH for each line-item in the Pre/Post Inventory list. This estimate should be sourced from â€¦***  
    * **Some general information about the pre-retrofit occupancy that can be used to apply the annual EFLH over an 8760 timeseries loadshape**

### Timeseries Data

The timeseries data should be provided as a CSV with the following columns:

| Field | Description | Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| start\_datetime | The datetime representing the start of the hourly meter read | Y |
| energy\_kwh | The energy consumption that took place during the hour associated with this meter read | Y |


## Verification Protocols

### Data Validation

Ongoing verification procedures include:

- Confirmation of data completeness  
- Assessment of burn hour calculations  
- Validation of circuit identification and mapping  
- Review of savings calculations

### Reasonableness Assessment

Multiple verification metrics ensure result validity:

1. Total savings represent <10% of facility consumption. 
2. Post-implementation operating hours maintain logical relationship to baseline hours  
3. Connected load measurements align with documented system specifications

This M\&V plan provides a robust framework for quantifying and verifying energy savings while maintaining conservative calculation approaches and comprehensive documentation standards.
