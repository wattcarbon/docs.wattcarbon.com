## Executive Summary

This document outlines the measurement and verification (M\&V) methodology and data intake requirements for the electrification projects managed by Elephant Energy. The plan encompasses baseline establishment, metering infrastructure, data collection protocols, and savings calculation methodologies. 

## Evidence of Asset

Elephant Energy will upload a photo of a receipt of each Asset that will include the line-item of the subsidy provided by this program. They will also need to include the heat pump serial number on Asset upload.

## Methodology Selection

We will use the [**Technical Specification: Quantifying energy use and emissions savings for electrification**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.electrification.url }}) methodology.

We expect to receive 12 pre-intervention bills representing approximately 12 months of data that will be provided upon Asset upload. We expect to use "From NREL Building Selection, if no reporting data is available (Baseline: 1.1.2.2 and Reporting: 1.2.3). Approximately 1-year post-intervention, WattCarbon will receive 12 post-intervention bills representing approximately 12 months of data. After receiving and auditing this data, if it passes data sufficiency requirements, the Asset will switch to "From EEMeter Model, if reporting data is available (Baseline: 1.1.2.1 and Reporting: 1.2.2.1). 

## Data Requirements

### Incorporated Data Requirements

The following are defined in the [**{{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.name }}**]({{ site.links.m_and_v.shared.url }}) methodology:

- Definitions  
- Electricity Carbon Intensity Calculations  
- Shared Data Intake Requirements  
- Consequential Carbon Accounting Rules  
- EAC Definition and Rules  
- Generated Versus Avoided Emissions

### User-Provided Data Requirements

The following is a static description of the required and optional fields for a given Asset. An updated CSV template with the correct column names [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/devices/csv/template/electrification_nrel_resstock_deemed) and timeseries description [is available here](https://api.wattcarbon.com/#tag/Devices/operation/upload_device_timeseries_devices__device_id__timeseries_post).

### Attributional Data

### Timeseries Data

The timeseries data should be provided with the following columns:

| Field | Description | Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| start\_date | The date representing the start of the bill cycle | Y |
| end\_date | The date representing the end of the bill cycle | Y |

## Data Management/Auditing Agreements

### Timeseries Data

Elephant Energy is partnering with Bayou Energy, who will supply the electricity and gas bills used in this analysis. At around the time of the intervention, Bayou will provide the most recent 12 bills leading up to the intervention. These bills will be used to establish the baseline consumption of the building.  One year following the intervention, Bayou will provide 12 post-intervention bills. These 12 bills should be after the intervention, starting with the second bill after the intervention.

For example, if an intervention took place on **June 5, 2022**, and the following bills existed for that home, we would take the bills 2021-06-18 through 2022-05-18 to represent the baseline consumption, we would *exclude* the bill 2022-06-10 as it is partially in both the pre \-and post-intervention periods, and we would take the bills 2022-07-12 through 2023-06-13 to represent reporting consumption.
