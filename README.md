# Welcome to the WEATS API & Data Onboarding Guide

#### WEATS (WattCarbon Energy Attribute Tracking System) enables users to:

- Track, manage, and report on decarbonization data across your entire portfolio. 
- Assigns a unique serial number to each watt-hour or gram of CO2
- Hourly tracking for every type of project, synced with actual grid carbon intensity
- Automated data transfer for always current carbon ROI
- API export of EAC records for third-party integration
