## Automated M&V and a System of Record for Decarbonization

Accelerate your journey to net-zero with data-driven insights and automated verification across your entire building portfolio.

## Data-Driven Decarbonization for Sustainability Leaders

Sustainability officers face the complex task of reducing carbon emissions across multiple buildings while proving the impact of their initiatives. Our Building Portfolio Decarbonization Dashboard is a technical, cloud-based analytics platform designed to meet this challenge. By combining Automated Measurement & Verification (M&V) with Hourly Carbon Accounting, it empowers you to make informed decisions backed by real data.

## Automated Measurement & Verification (M&V)

Leverage advanced analytics to automatically validate and track the energy savings and emissions reductions from your sustainability projects. The dashboard’s automated M&V capabilities continuously analyze high-frequency building data to provide near real-time savings estimates. This modern "M&V 2.0" approach delivers results more quickly and accurately, and at potentially lower cost, than traditional manual methods.

### Key benefits of Automated M&V:

- **Continuous Performance Tracking**: Instantly see the impact of efficiency upgrades or operational changes. No more waiting for annual evaluations – get verification of energy and carbon savings as they accrue in real time.
- **Increased Confidence in Savings**: Automated, meter-based verification increases trust in reported results, giving you and your stakeholders confidence that sustainability investments are paying off. Validate the ROI of projects with credible data.
- **Reduced Effort and Cost**: By automating complex analysis, you save time and reduce the need for external consultants or manual calculations. Focus your team on strategy rather than number-crunching, and achieve verification at a fraction of the usual cost.

## Hourly Carbon Accounting

Achieve a new level of precision in emissions tracking with granular, hour-by-hour carbon accounting. Our dashboard calculates your portfolio's carbon footprint in real time, reflecting the actual carbon intensity of the electricity and fuels your buildings use each hour. This goes far beyond traditional annual or monthly averages, revealing when emissions are highest and helping you optimize accordingly.

### Why Hourly Carbon Accounting matters:

- **Granular Insights**: Identify daily and hourly peaks in carbon emissions and uncover patterns (e.g. higher emissions during peak grid periods) that annual accounting would miss. These insights guide smarter scheduling of energy use and load shifting to cut emissions when it counts.
- **Transparent & Defensible Data**: Get a transparent, verifiable, and defensible record of your carbon impact that holds up to scrutiny. As investors, regulators, and boards increasingly expect rigorous proof of decarbonization progress, hourly data provides the credible detail you need.
- **Maximize Renewable Usage**: Measure how effectively you leverage renewable energy and storage, hour by hour. Track how solar generation or battery discharge aligns with consumption to ensure you're using green energy when it's available – and reducing reliance during carbon-intensive peak times.

## Portfolio-Wide Analytics & Reporting

Our dashboard consolidates data from all your buildings into one intuitive interface. Sophisticated analytics turn raw information into actionable insights, enabling you to drive decisions with confidence:

- **Portfolio Benchmarking**: Compare performance across buildings to pinpoint leaders and laggards. Identify which facilities offer the biggest opportunities for improvement in energy efficiency or carbon reduction at a glance.
- **Custom Dashboards & Reports**: Dive into interactive charts or export polished reports to share with executives and stakeholders. Tailor the metrics and visuals to align with your ESG goals and reporting frameworks (e.g. GRESB, CDP), ensuring data is presentation-ready.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Stay informed with alerts for anomalies or target thresholds – such as sudden spikes in energy use or when a building exceeds its carbon budget for the day. Proactive notifications let you address issues immediately and maintain control over your performance.
- **Seamless Data Integration**: The platform automatically pulls data from utility meters, building management systems, and IoT sensors across your portfolio. This unified data stream means your carbon and energy metrics are always up-to-date without manual data entry or spreadsheets.

## Proven Impact and Reliability

Built on industry-leading methodologies, the Building Portfolio Decarbonization Dashboard is grounded in proven science and technology:

- **Standards-Based M&V**: Uses established IPMVP-compliant techniques and the latest advances from M&V 2.0 research to ensure accuracy and reliability in savings calculations.
- **Secure Cloud Platform**: Access your dashboard anywhere with confidence. Our platform employs enterprise-grade security and undergoes regular audits, so your data remains protected and private.
- **Scalable Solution**: Whether you manage 5 buildings or 500, the dashboard scales with you. High-performance processing ensures smooth analytics even as data volume grows, so you'll never miss a beat as your sustainability program expands.
